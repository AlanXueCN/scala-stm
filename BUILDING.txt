SOURCE

scala-stm is built using sbt, from http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/
sbt will download the correct version of scala and ScalaTest with

  sbt update

At this point, you should be able to compile and run the tests with

  sbt test


DOCS

The project's website is currently hosted using GitHub pages.  This means
that instead of being a subdirectory in the master branch of git, it is
at the top level of a branch named gh-pages.  Github automatically runs
the entire contents of the gh-pages branch through the jekyll markup tool,
and then places the resulting site at username.github.com/scala-stm-api.

If you want to test out changes to the website locally or statically
generate the site or a PDF, install jekyll using RubyGems (see
https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/install).  In the root of the
gh-pages, run jekyll --server --auto, and the website will be available
on localhost:4000, with edits immediately available.

The api subdirectory of the gh-pages branch is currently manually
synchronized with the target/scala_2.8.1/doc/main/api that results from
"sbt doc" on the master branch.

PDF construction of the docs is not yet good quality, but the best results so
far have resulted from (in a populated _site subdirectory):

    wkhtmltopdf -B 1in -L 1in -R 1.25in -T 1in --footer-right '[page]' \
        -s Letter --user-style-sheet css/print_like.css toc \
        --toc-header-text 'Table of Contents' \
        `grep "li..a.href='[a-z_.]*'" just_links.html | sed -e "s/^[^']*'//" -e
"s/'.*//"` \

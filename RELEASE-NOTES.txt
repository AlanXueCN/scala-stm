ScalaSTM - 0.6 RELEASE NOTES

Changes between 0.5 and 0.6:

* retry and retryFor added to the Java compatibility interface.

* uses of scala.actor.threadpool.TimeUnit in the interface replaced with
  java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, to avoid making ScalaSTM depend on the
  separate scala-actors jar in Scala 2.10.

----

Changes between 0.4 and 0.5:

* Added scala.concurrent.stm.japi.STM, which makes it much cleaner to
  access ScalaSTM functionality from Java.

----

Changes between 0.3 and 0.4:

* CommitBarrier added, which allows multiple atomic blocks (each on its
  own thread) to commit together.

* Small performance improvements.

* STMBench7 benchmark support added.

* Automatic selection of STMImpl in most cases.

----

Changes between 0.2 and 0.3:

* Support for Scala 2.9.0.RC1.

* Bug fixes (see https://github.com/nbronson/scala-stm/issues/closed ).

* Timeouts for modular blocking.  Set timeouts at the atomic block using
  atomic.withRetryTimeout, or at the retry site using retryFor.

----

Changes between 0.1 and 0.2:

* Substantial performance improvements, especially for nested atomic
  blocks.

* TSet.View and TMap.View are integrated into the Scala collection
  class hierarchy, with factory companion objects and Builder and
  CanBuildFrom instances.

* A fix for whileCommitting handlers (issue #3).

* TxnLocal can now be read and written from while-preparing and while-
  committing handlers.  Combining TxnLocal and life-cycle handlers is
  now more concise.

* Transaction statistics can be enabled for the default algorithm
  with the VM argument -Dccstm.stats=1 (details in the ScalaDoc for
  scala.concurrent.stm.ccstm.CCSTM).

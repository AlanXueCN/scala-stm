ScalaSTM - 0.2-SNAPSHOT RELEASE NOTES

Changes between 0.1 and 0.2-SNAPSHOT:

* Substantial performance improvements, especially for nested atomic
  blocks.  Nested atomic blocks without orAtomic are optimistically
  subsumed, then retried without subsumption if partial rollback is
  needed.

* TSet.View and TMap.View are integrated into the Scala collection
  class hierarchy, with factory companion objects and Builder and
  CanBuildFrom instances.

* A fix for whileCommitting handlers (issue #3).

* TxnLocal can now be accessed during from while-preparing and while-
  committing handlers.  Combining TxnLocal and life-cycle handlers is
  now more concise.

Snapshot releases deployed to the scala-tools.org repository are tested
and functional, but may have changing APIs.

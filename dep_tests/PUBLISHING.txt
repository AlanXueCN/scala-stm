DEPLOYING THE SCALA-STM ARTIFACT

With a proper credentials file publishing a snapshot or release artifact is
accomplished with

  sbt +publish

TESTING DEPLOYMENT AND ARTIFACT USAGE

To test using published artifacts via sbt, select the desired scala-stm
artifact in dep_tests/sbt/project/build/DepTestsSBTProject.scala .
Make sure to disable the scala-tools snapshot repo when testing release

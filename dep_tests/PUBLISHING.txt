DEPLOYING THE SCALA-STM ARTIFACT

With a proper credentials file publishing a snapshot or release artifact is
accomplished with

  sbt +test (or bin/all_tests)
  sbt +publish

TESTING DEPLOYMENT AND ARTIFACT USAGE

To test using published artifacts via sbt, select the desired scala-stm
artifact in dep_tests/sbt/project/build/DepTestsSBTProject.scala .
Make sure to disable the scala-tools snapshot repo when testing release
builds.  Then

  cd dep_tests/sbt
  sbt +update +run

To test building using maven2, edit dep_tests/maven/pom.xml, then

  cd dep_tests/maven
  mvn -U compile

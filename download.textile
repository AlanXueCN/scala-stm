The latest release of ScalaSTM is version 0.1.  To get it you can
* use sbt or maven2 dependency management,
* download a prebuilt JAR: ["scala-stm_2.8.1-0.1.jar":http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases/org/scala-tools/scala-stm_2.8.1/0.1/scala-stm_2.8.1-0.1.jar], or
* build it ["from source":#manual].

h2(#sbt). sbt

Tell @sbt@ about a dependency on ScalaSTM by adding the following line to your project definition class (in @project/build@)

{% highlight scala %}
val scala_stm = "org.scala-tools" %% "scala-stm" % "0.1"
{% endhighlight %}

@sbt update@ will then download the correct @scala-stm@ JAR and use it for building.

h2(#maven). Maven2

Separate artifacts are published for each version of Scala, so the desired Scala version (such as 2.8.1) must be included in the @artifactId@ for Maven (@sbt@ automatically handles this). The ScalaSTM dependency for your @pom.xml@ is

{% highlight xml %}
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.scala-tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>scala-stm_2.8.1</artifactId>
    <version>0.1</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
{% endhighlight %}

h2(#manual). Building from source

ScalaSTM is hosted at ["github.com/nbronson/scala-stm":http://github.com/nbronson/scala-stm].  If you system has @git@, the best way to get the source code is to clone this repository.

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/nbronson/scala-stm.git
{% endhighlight %}

If @git@ is not available you can download a "tar.gz":https://github.com/nbronson/scala-stm/tarball/master or "zip":https://github.com/nbronson/scala-stm/zipball/master source bundle.  These are automatically generated from the current state of the master branch.

Building and testing is done with ["sbt":http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/].
# Download the test-time dependency (@scalatest@)
{% highlight bash %}
sbt update
{% endhighlight %}
# Compile everything and run the tests
{% highlight bash %}
sbt test
{% endhighlight %}
# Build a JAR file (it will end up in a subdirectory of @target@)
{% highlight bash %}
sbt package
{% endhighlight %}

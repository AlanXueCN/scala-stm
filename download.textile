h2(#github). Source on github

If you system has "git":http://git-scm.com/, the best way to get the ScalaSTM source code is to clone the github repository

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/nbronson/scala-stm-api.git
{% endhighlight %}

".tar.gz":https://github.com/nbronson/scala-stm-api/tarball/master and ".zip":https://github.com/nbronson/scala-stm-api/zipball/master source bundles are also available.

Once you've got the source, use "sbt":http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/ to download @scala-stm@'s dependencies (currently just @scala@ and @scalatest@), compile and run the tests, and build the JAR file.

{% highlight bash %}
sbt update
sbt test
sbt package
{% endhighlight %}

The Scala STM expert group was assembled by Martin Odersky, the creator of the Scala programming language, with the aim of producing an STM suitable for inclusion in Scala's standard library.  It includes

* Jonas Bon&eacute;r -- "Akka":http://akkasource.org
* Nathan Bronson -- "CCSTM":http://ppl.stanford.edu/ccstm + Stanford's "PPL (Pervasive Parallelism Lab)":http://ppl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Publications
* Guy Korland -- "DeuceSTM":http://www.deucestm.org/ + Tel-Aviv University's "MultiCore Algorithmics Group":http://mcg.cs.tau.ac.il/projects
* Aleksandar Prokopec -- "Scala Parallel Collections":http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/150220/files/pc.pdf + EPFL's "LAMP (Programming Methods Laboratory)":http://lamp.epfl.ch/publications/index.html.en

We conduct all of our discussions on the "scala-stm-expert-group":http://groups.google.com/group/scala-stm-expert-group mailing list at Google Groups, where we've been joined by other Scala, JVM and concurrency veterans.  Our code is hosted at ["http://github.com/nbronson/scala-stm":http://github.com/nbronson/scala-stm].

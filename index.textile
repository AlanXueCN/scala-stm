Welcome from the Scala STM Expert Group.  We're working on a lightweight software transactional memory for Scala, inspired by the STMs in Haskell and Clojure.  Our target is inclusion in Scala's standard library for 2.9 or the next point-release after, but you can use it today.

ScalaSTM is a single JAR with no dependencies, and includes
* An API that supports multiple STM implementations
* A reference implementation based on CCSTM

ScalaSTM provides a mutable cell called a @Ref@.  If you build a shared data structure using immutable objects and @Ref@-s, then you can access it from multiple threads or actors.  No @synchronized@, no deadlocks or race conditions, and good scalability.  Included are concurrent sets and maps, and we also have an easier and safer replacement for @wait@ and @notifyAll@.


h2(#whatisit). What is STM?

Software transactional memory is a mediator that sits between a critical section of your code (the atomic block) and the program's heap.  The STM intervenes during reads and writes in the atomic block, allowing it to check and/or avoid interference other threads.  If the loads and stores of multiple threads have gotten interleaved, then all of the writes of the atomic block are _rolled back_ and the entire block is retried.  If the accesses by the critical section are not interleaved, then it is as if they were done atomically and the atomic block can be _committed_.  Other threads or actors can only see committed changes.

STMs use optimistic concurrency control.  They optimistically assume that atomic blocks will be able to run in parallel, and then back up and retry if that speculation is incorrect.  Keeping the old versions of data so that you can back up imposes some overhead, but optimistic concurrency typically has better scalability than alternative approaches.


h2(#nomagic). No magic

There have been several ambitious attempts to create STMs that can run existing sequential imperative code in parallel.  This is a difficult task that requires a lot of magic, because calls to the STM need to be inserted for _every_ load and store of a non-final field or array element inside an atomic block.  Good performance is also difficult because of the large numbers of reads and writes.

The ScalaSTM API avoids the need for magic by only managing @Ref@-s.  This means that there are fewer memory locations to manage, and no bytecode instrumentation or compiler modifications are required.  As in Haskell and Clojure, the usefulness of @Ref@ is multiplied by the language's good support for immutable data structures.  ScalaSTM also includes concurrent sets and maps that can be used in transactions.


h2(#whatfor).  Who is it for?

ScalaSTM is for programmers whose threads or actors need to coordinate access to shared data.  In a server, this might be the list of active connections or a cache.  In a client, this might be a partial result or worker thread status.


h2(#pros).  Pros

* *Say what you mean.*  You write @atomic@, ScalaSTM executes it atomically without deadlocks or races.  There is no need to map locks to data.  Nested atomic blocks do the right thing, so you can build complex thread-safe operations from simple ones.

* *Readers scale.*  All of the threads in a system can read data without interfering with each other.  Optimistic algorithms take better advantage of the cache on modern architectures than pessimistic approaches.

* *Exceptions automatically trigger cleanup.*  If an atomic block throws an exception, all of the @Ref@-s are reset to their original state.  (You can change this default if you like.)

* *Waiting for complex conditions is easy.*  If an atomic block doesn't find the state it's looking for, it can call @retry@ to back up and wait for any of its inputs to change.  If there are multiple ways to succeed, you can chain them and ScalaSTM will try them all.

* *Simple.*  ScalaSTM is just a stand-alone library, so it doesn't affect the parts of the application that don't use it.  This means that you can include it inside a framework or hidden component.


h2(#cons).  Cons

* *Two extra characters per read or write.*  If @x@ is a @Ref@, then @x()@ reads its value and @x() = v@ writes it.

* *Single-thread overheads.*  In most cases STMs are slower when the program isn't actually running in parallel.  We've gotten the actual costs pretty low, so for most uses this won't be a problem.  Rollback can be useful even in single-threaded programs to automatically clean up on an exception.

* *Rollback doesn't mix well with I/O.*  Only changes to @Ref@-s are undone automatically.  The ScalaSTM API includes hooks so you can perform manual compensation or DB integration, but there is no way to recall packets or pixels.  Of course, you probably shouldn't be doing I/O while you hold a lock, either.

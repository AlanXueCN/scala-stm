Welcome from the Scala STM ["Expert Group":expert_group.html].  We're working on a lightweight software transactional memory for Scala, inspired by the STMs in Haskell and Clojure.  Our target is inclusion in Scala's standard library for 2.9.1, but you can use our draft release today.  We'd like your ["feedback":http://groups.google.com/group/scala-stm-expert-group/].

ScalaSTM is a single JAR with no dependencies, and includes
* An API that supports multiple STM implementations
* A reference implementation based on CCSTM

ScalaSTM provides a mutable cell called a @Ref@.  If you build a shared data structure using immutable objects and @Ref@-s, then you can access it from multiple threads or actors.  No @synchronized@, no deadlocks or race conditions, and good scalability.  Included are concurrent sets and maps, and we also have an easier and safer replacement for @wait@ and @notifyAll@.

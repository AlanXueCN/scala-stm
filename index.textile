Welcome from the Scala STM Expert Group.  We're working on a lightweight software transactional memory for Scala, inspired by the STMs in Haskell and Clojure.  Our target is inclusion in Scala's standard library for 2.9 or the next point-release after, but you can use our draft release today.  We'd like your ["feedback":http://groups.google.com/group/scala-stm-expert-group/].

ScalaSTM is a single JAR with no dependencies, and includes
* An API that supports multiple STM implementations
* A reference implementation based on CCSTM

ScalaSTM provides a mutable cell called a @Ref@.  If you build a shared data structure using immutable objects and @Ref@-s, then you can access it from multiple threads or actors.  No @synchronized@, no deadlocks or race conditions, and good scalability.  Included are concurrent sets and maps, and we also have an easier and safer replacement for @wait@ and @notifyAll@.

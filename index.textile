title: Library-Based Software Transactional Memory for Scala
short_title: Welcome
---

Welcome from the creators of Scala STM.  We've built a lightweight software transactional memory for Scala, inspired by the STMs in Haskell and Clojure while taking advantage of Scala's power and performance.

ScalaSTM is a single JAR with no dependencies, and includes
* An API that supports multiple STM implementations
* A reference implementation based on CCSTM
* Scalable concurrent sets and maps (with fast snapshots) that can be used inside or outside transactions

ScalaSTM provides a mutable cell called a @Ref@.  If you build a shared data structure using immutable objects and @Ref@-s, then you can access it from multiple threads or actors.  No @synchronized@, no deadlocks or race conditions, and good scalability.  Included are concurrent sets and maps, and we also have an easier and safer replacement for @wait@ and @notifyAll@.

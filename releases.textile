The latest release of ScalaSTM is version 0.2.  To get it you can
* follow "sbt instructions":#sbt or "maven2 instructions":#maven, or
* download a prebuilt JAR: ["scala-stm_2.8.1-0.2.jar":http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases/org/scala-tools/scala-stm_2.8.1/0.2/scala-stm_2.8.1-0.2.jar].

h2(#notes). Release notes

Changes between 0.1 and 0.2
* Substantial performance improvements, especially for nested atomic blocks.  Nested atomic blocks without @orAtomic@ are optimistically subsumed (run directly in their parent transaction), then retried without subsumption if partial rollback is needed.
* @TSet.View@ and @TMap.View@ are integrated into the Scala collection class hierarchy, with factory companion objects and @Builder@ and @CanBuildFrom@ instances.
* A fix for @whileCommitting@ handlers (issue ["#3":https://github.com/nbronson/scala-stm/issues/closed#issue/3]).
* @TxnLocal@ can now be read and written from while-preparing and while-committing handlers.  Combining @TxnLocal@ and life-cycle handlers is now more concise.
* Transaction statistics can be enabled for the default algorithm with the VM argument @-Dccstm.stats=1@ (for more information see the ScalaDoc for @scala.concurrent.stm.ccstm.CCSTM@).

h2(#sbt). SBT

Tell @sbt@ about a dependency on ScalaSTM by adding the following line to your project definition class (in @project/build@)

{% highlight scala %}
val scala_stm = "org.scala-tools" %% "scala-stm" % "0.2"
{% endhighlight %}

@sbt update@ will then download the correct @scala-stm@ JAR and use it for building.

h2(#maven). Maven2

Separate artifacts are published for each version of Scala, so the desired Scala version (such as 2.8.1) must be included in the @artifactId@ for Maven (@sbt@ automatically handles this). The ScalaSTM dependency for your @pom.xml@ is

{% highlight xml %}
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.scala-tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>scala-stm_2.8.1</artifactId>
    <version>0.2</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
{% endhighlight %}

The deployment tests inside the ScalaSTM source include a complete ["pom.xml":https://github.com/nbronson/scala-stm/blob/master/dep_tests/maven/pom.xml], including the repository configuration for @org.scala-tools@.
